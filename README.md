Here is the **README rewritten as one big paragraph**, *BUT* all important commands are placed on **their own lines** and **bolded** for clarity:

The SKYNDR project is a modern, responsive digital marketing agency website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and deployed using Firebase Hosting. 

It includes fully customized sliders, animated sections, mobile-first layouts, a testimonial carousel, a dynamic “Why Work With Us” progress animation, and a styled contact form with a custom dropdown. 

To deploy this project, you must first install Node.js from nodejs.org, then verify installation using the commands:
**node -v**
**npm -v**
Next, install the Firebase CLI globally using:
**npm install -g firebase-tools**
Then log in to Firebase using:
**firebase login** which is sikerhub
After logging in, navigate to the project folder and initialize Firebase Hosting by running:
**firebase init hosting**
Select your Firebase project, choose your public directory, configure settings, and complete initialization. Once everything is ready, you can deploy your website live using:
**firebase deploy**

Firebase will then generate your live hosting URL. The project includes static frontend files such as index.html, style.css, script.js, and image assets. SKYNDR is a performance-focused agency working with auto-film and detailing businesses to generate leads, improve conversions, and scale campaigns. This repository contains the exact code served on Firebase Hosting.
